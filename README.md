# Three.js Tube Geometry Camera Follow

This project demonstrates a 3D scene using Three.js, where a camera follows inside a tube geometry. Random geometries are spawned inside the tube, and a point light is placed within to enhance the visual appearance. The project runs on a Node.js server (`server.js`).

## Features

- **Tube Geometry:** The main structure is a 3D tube geometry that the camera navigates through.
- **Camera Follow:** The camera smoothly follows the path inside the tube, creating an immersive experience.
- **Random Geometries:** Various random geometries are spawned within the tube to add dynamic elements to the scene.
- **Point Light:** A point light is positioned inside the tube to enhance the visual effects and add depth to the scene.
