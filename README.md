# Solar System with Three.js

## Description

This is a Three.js project where I have created a complete solar system without using any 3D objects from external sources. All the celestial bodies and elements are created using textures, geometry, and particles provided by Three.js.

## Features

- **Sun**: A textured sphere with emissive lighting to simulate the sun's glow.
- **Planets**: Each planet is created with unique textures and orbits around the sun.
- **Moons**: Some planets have moons that orbit them.
- **Stars**: Background stars created using particles to add depth to the scene.
- **Orbit Paths**: Visual representations of the orbits for each planet.
- **Camera Controls**: Interactive controls to explore the solar system.
- **Lighting**: Dynamic lighting to enhance the visual realism of the solar system.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solar-system-threejs.git
